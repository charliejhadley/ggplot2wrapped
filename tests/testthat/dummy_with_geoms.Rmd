# Introduction

This document talks about geom_point and geom_line but these shouldn't be detected.

```{r setup}
library(ggplot2)
```

Here's a simple plot:

```{r plot1}
ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(x = mpg, y = hp))
```

Another section mentions geom_col in the text.

```{r plot2, fig.cap="A plot with geom_line"}
ggplot(data = iris) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width), linewidth = 2) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "red")
```

The chunk option above has "geom_line" in it but that shouldn't be detected.

```{r}
# Comment mentioning geom_bar
geom_smooth(aes(x = a, y = b))
```
