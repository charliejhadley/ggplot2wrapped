# Quarto Analysis

We often use geom_histogram and geom_density for distributions.

```{r}
#| label: setup
library(ggplot2)
```

Creating visualizations with geom_boxplot:

```{r}
#| label: fig-scatter
#| fig-cap: "Scatter plot using geom_point"
ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(mpg, hp), size = 2)
```

Text about geom_violin shouldn't be detected.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = category), stat = "count") +
  geom_text(aes(x = x, y = y, label = "foo"))
```

Inline code like `geom_ribbon()` shouldn't be detected either.
